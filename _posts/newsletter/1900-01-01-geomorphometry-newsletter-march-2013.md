Still working on the extended abstract for the next conference? Don't worry: the submission deadline for Geomorphometry has been pushed to **1st of April** (2 weeks extension). This is a one time extension, so please try to follow this deadline closely. The submission instructions are available here. Several people asked us about the content and length of the extended abstracts.
