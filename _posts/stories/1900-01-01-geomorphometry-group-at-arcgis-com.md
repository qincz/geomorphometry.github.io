Following our geomoprhomerty.org 2011 conference in Redlands we created a group called geomorphomerty at arcgis.com. The objective is to facilitate and engage a larger community of people around the world outside geomorphometry.org, especially esri users as well as the general GIS community.

Group members can create and share maps within the group and to the public as well. As a start a selection of global landforms maps are displayed, which will be expanded in the future.
