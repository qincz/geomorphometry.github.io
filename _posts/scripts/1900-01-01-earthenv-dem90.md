EarthEnv-DEM90: 90 m resolution digital elevation model from fused ASTER and SRTM data is available for download from: [http://www.earthenv.org/DEM](http://www.earthenv.org/DEM)

**Available layers:** 

smoothed elevation

**Grid definition:** 

100 m resolution global

proj4:  +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84

**Lineage:** 

The data distributed here are in EHdr format, unprojected and referenced to the WGS84 geodetic datum. They are derived from CGIAR-CSI SRTM v4.1 and ASTER GDEM v2 data products. These data have been processed and merged to provide continuous coverage of ~91% of the globe. Processing and merging methodology are available in [Robinson et al. (2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271613002360).

**Data owner:**  NCEAS, NASA, NSF, and Yale University
