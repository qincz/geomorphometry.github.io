The previous edition of the conference was postponed due the global pandemic. Contributions to the conference were evaluated by the scientific/organizing committee, and authors were notified of acceptance/rejection of their extended abstract; revised abstracts were collected into a volume entitled "Geomorphometry 2020 Conference Proceedings" edited by M. Alvioli, I. Marchesini, L. Melelli & P. Guth and published by CNR Edizioni (Rome, 2020). Individual contributions and the whole volume can be [downloaded here](https://doi.org/10.30437/geomorphometry2020).

Authors were invited to extend their contributions to full article length, and submit them for pubblication in a special issue of Transactions in GIS, entitled "Geomorphometry 2020" which wil be published in the third quarter of 2021 (Volume 25); submissions for the 2020 special issue are currently closed.

The 2021 conference will tentatively be a mixed in presence - online event, so that whoever can/want to travel to Perugia is welcome to do so, but people will still be able to participate in the conference remotely. Please refere to the Covid-19 link on the main page for further and updated information about this. For online presenters: we are aware of the different time zones issue; we are working on it.

Submissions to the 2021 event are now close and submitted papers have been peer reviewed; contributions accepted for the 2020 will be retained for the 2021 event. Based on the actual number of new accepted contributions we will consider publishing a new conference proceedings and/or a new journal publication.
