The International LIDAR Mapping Forum (ILMF) took place in Denver CO from March 3-5 2010. The event drew more than 500 attendees and 60 exhibiting companies.The program placed both an emphasis on research and innovations. At ILMF 2009, **ASPRS** (American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) incorporated a special **LiDAR ‘hot topics’** session that tackled the challenge of developing standards and best practices for the industry. The workshop was extremely well attended and they will be hosting another session at ILMF 2010.
