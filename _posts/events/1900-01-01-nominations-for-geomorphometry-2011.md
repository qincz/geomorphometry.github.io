The decision about the next geomorphometry conference will be published on the geomorphometry website after 15th of November 2009.

### Priorities:

Proposals that specifically emphasize the following issues will receive a priority during the selection:

- **This is a 5-day event** with optional excursion.
- The event consists of three types of sessions: **(1) conference, (2) workshops and (3) training courses**. The workshops can be focused on some type of international collaboration or run as discussion panels. The training courses and workshops can be scheduled in the weekend to minimize the logistics costs.
- The location of event **is within 3 hours of travelling from the international airport**. The conference organizers will assists the participants in reaching the venue.
- **The costs of organizing the logistics are minimized** (the most economic option to encourage waverers) and/or a sponsorship is guaranteed.
