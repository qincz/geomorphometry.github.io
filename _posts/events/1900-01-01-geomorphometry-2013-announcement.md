### AIMS AND SCOPE
The aim of Geomorphometry 2013 is to create a platform for better communications and scholarly exchange among researchers in the fields of terrain analysis, geomorphometry, environmental modeling and geographical information sciences. It is the intention of the conference organizer to allow sufficient discussion and exchange of ideas during the conference sessions, so that the conference will be run in the single session format with sufficient time for each paper presentation and follow-up discussion.

**Conference language: English**


### SUBMISSIONS
Prospective authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 4 pages (ca 2000 words) and at least 2 pages by 1st of April 2013. Extended abstracts must be original works by the authors, not be currently under review in the same form by another outlet and not submitted elsewhere prior to the notification date.

**Author guidelines**

Extended abstracts that have been accepted for the conference (either as poster presentations or oral talks) must be submitted before 15th of September 2013. Please follow the author guidelines closely. The submitted digital copies of extended abstracts (PDF) that do not comply with the author guidelines might not be included in the conference proceedings and shared at the conference.

After the conference, a number of authors will be invited to submission a full article for the special issue on “Advances in Geomorphometry: new technologies, data and software for DEM analysis” in the Earth Surface Dynamics (ESurf) journal (this is an interactive Open Access journal).

Nanjing Normal University, located in Nanjing–an old ancient capital city of Six Dynasties, which is a key university of Jiangsu Province. The history of Nanjing Normal University can be traced back to Sanjiang Normal Institute, which was established by Zhang Zhidong, Governor-General of Jiangsu and Jiangxi, in 1902. It has three campuses including Xianlin, Suiyuan and Zijin, of which Suiyuan is a key historical site under state protection and has been praised as “the most beautiful campus of the east”. The university covers a total area of 2,199,575 m2 and the built-up area is 1,064,103m2; it has 24 colleges with 2 independent ones added. The number of the faculty is 3293, 482 of them with Senior Title and 842 with the Vice-senior. 16,213 undergraduates (without the consideration of independent colleges), 6681 masters and 963 doctors are pursuing knowledge of various fields, as well as 1725 on-the-job graduates working for the master degrees and more than 5000 adults for the higher and further education.
 
School of Geography is the most prestigious college of Nanjing Normal University. It has three major research platforms including Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographical Environment of Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Change and Ecological Construction and Regional planning and Development Research Center, there are 8 departments in the college including Geographic Science, Tourism Management, Land Management, Geographic Information System, Marine Science, Surveying and Mapping Engineering, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering. Nanjing Normal University have already hosted the International Science Seminar on the Terrain Analysis and Digital Terrain Stimulation (TADTM) in 2006. Later in 2008, the team participated in organizing ISPRS Summer School as well.
